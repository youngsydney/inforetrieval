COSC 488: Introduction to Information Retrieval

How to Run: 
	Compile and run the run.py file. The method controls preprocessing, indexing, and query processing. 

The program will output to the screen the reports on the query processing MAP scores and times by Retrieval Model. 

Optional:
If you would like to test the effect of the query length on MAP, you can look at line 53 in run.py, change 'title' to 'desc' or 'narr' 
	to see how the results change depending on the length of the query.
